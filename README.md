Requirements for Chaos

> - aperiodicity
> - exponential divergence of positions in phase space --> typically bounded --> we need mixing of phase lines --> need condition that it does not repeat itself --> aperiodicity

$$ \sum_{i=0}^{N} (\frac{1}{2}) \log{abc}  $$
$ \sum_{i=0}^{N} (\frac{1}{2}) \log{abc}  $
